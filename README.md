# kwanmath.vector
Vectors the Kwan Systems way. Includes features to make vector math as convenient as it is in POV-Ray, and is inspired by the latter's syntax.

* Dot Product (vdot): Calculates the dot product of two vectors or stacks of vectors, with support for broadcasting.
* Vector Length (vlength): Calculates the length of a vector as the square root of its dot product with itself.
* Normalization (vnormalize): Calculates a unit-length vector parallel to the given vector.
* Angle Calculation (vangle): Calculates the angle between two vectors, with options to return the result in degrees or radians.
* Cross Product (vcross): Calculates the cross-product of two vectors or stacks of vectors.
* Vector Composition and Decomposition (vcomp, vdecomp): Provides functions to compose a stack of vectors from components and decompose a vector into its components, respectively.
